# Infinite Scroll

This is a simple JavaScript application that demonstrates infinite scrolling. It adds new elements to the page as the user scrolls down.

## Installation

To use this application, simply download the `index.html` and `script.js` files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

To use the application, simply scroll down the page. New elements will be added to the page as you scroll.

## Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the `colors` array in the `script.js` file. This array contains the CSS classes that are used to style the new elements that are added to the page.

You can also modify the `handleScroll` function to change the behavior of the infinite scrolling. For example, you could change the delay time between adding new elements or modify the threshold at which new elements are added.
